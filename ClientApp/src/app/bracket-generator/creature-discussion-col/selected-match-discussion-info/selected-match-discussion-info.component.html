          <p>Balrogs are tall and menacing beings who can shroud themselves in fire, darkness, and shadow. They are armed with fiery whips "of many thongs", and occasionally used long swords. In Tolkien's later conception, they could not be readily vanquishedâ€”a certain stature was required by the would-be hero.</p>
